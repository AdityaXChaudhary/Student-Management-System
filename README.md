# Student Management System

A Java-based Student Management System for handling student records, course registrations, grading, and related academic operations. This project is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates object-oriented designs in Java.

## Features

- Student record creation, viewing, and editing
- Enrollment in courses
- Grade management
- User-friendly console interface

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) (version 8 or above)
- A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or command line access

### Running the Project

**Important:**  
Do **NOT** run `Main.java` directly from the command line without proper configuration. Instead, to debug or run the system, open `Main.java` in your IDE and use the built-in debugging tools.  
This ensures correct handling of input/output and makes troubleshooting easier.

## How to Debug `Main.java`

1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Locate `Main.java` in the source folder (typically `src/Main.java`).
3. Set breakpoints as needed for your debugging session.
4. Use the IDE’s debug/run features rather than executing with `java Main.java` from the terminal.

This screenshot illustrates the main interface for managing student records. Users can add, update, delete, and view student data.

### Debugging and Student Form Validation

Here, the system is being debugged using VS Code. The interface also shows an error dialog for invalid input, such as non-numeric ID or age.
